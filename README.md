# Classic Arcade Game - Udacity p3

## Getting Started & Installation

To get started, clone the repository or download the zip file, then open the index.html in a browser of your choice.

## Playing the Game
The Game will begin as soon as it is opened in the browser. Each time you make it across to the end you will kill another enemy bug. When all the enemy bugs are gone, you win.

To Play: Move your character using the _up_, _down_, _left_, and _right_ arrow keys. You must get your character to the other side (where the blue squares are). Each time you do, the enemy bugs will lose 1 of their companions. Once you kill all the enemy bugs, you win.
